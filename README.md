Yahtzee X
=========

The source code for the freeware version of Yahtzeeâ„¢ I wrote in Cocoa for Mac OS X 10.0

It isn't pretty and was built using Apple's Project Builder which became Xcode. I tried to open in the latest version of Xcode that I have with no success, but maybe someone out there would like to give it a try.

To the best of my knowledge, Yahtzee is a trademark of Hasbro.
